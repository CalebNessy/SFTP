 I was the only person working on this project. I learned that working in a team is way easier than working by yourself. 
 I created a video on how I came up on the idea, you can find it in the about page.
 
 
 Some of the hardest challenges I had to overcome were in creating the cart. I had a hard time figuring out how to add specific item and quantities to the cart, and how to order them and transfer the items to the orderHistory table. 
 
 I also had trouble with Chrome when I changed main.css, my website wouldn't update in Chrome. I finally moved to Microsoft Edge, and thankfully that worked for changing css. 
 (Edit: The website now works in Chrome. I think it just took a long time to realize the website updated.)
 
I talked to Micah from Dev Catalyst to see if the php mail() function would work on the Dev Catalyst servers, and he said that they weren't set up for that.

My favorite feature about the website is the login and signup system. Part of the reason it is my favorite feature is because it took me a while to create, and by a while, I mean a month or so.

I am really happy on the end result, and can't wait to use these skills if I create a buisness some day!
